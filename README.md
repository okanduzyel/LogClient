LogClient is designed by Okan DÃœZYEL for logging internet connection status and program activities on individual computers during lab sections. It is meant for students, and each installation requires a unique registration based on the computer's MAC address.

## Features
- Requires one-time registration for each computer **using a unique activation code.**
- Logs internet connection status (Connected/Disconnected).
- Program records activities and timestamps **with cryptographic output.**

## Registration and Activation (macOS, Linux, and Windows)

## Usage

Once registered and activated, the program continuously logs internet connection status and program activities. It runs in the background and requires no further interaction from the user.

1. **For macOS**

- Extract the zip file in your user directory, for example, "/Users/XXXXXXXXXX" (replace XXXXXXXXXX with your username). Please avoid using another directory.
