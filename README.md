## Usage

Once registered and activated, the program continuously logs internet connection status and program activities. It runs in the background and requires no further interaction from the user.

1. **For macOS**

- Extract the zip file in your user directory, for example, "/Users/XXXXXXXXXX" (replace XXXXXXXXXX with your username). Please avoid using another directory.

- The `license.dat` file will be automatically created during the extraction process.

- While the program is running, it will generate a new log file named with the student number, day, month, and year.
